# Spaceflight News

## Technologies

This site is powered by htmx, Nunjucks, and the Spaceflight News API (SNAPI).

## About

While htmx is designed to work best with hypermedia responses, this website intends to serve as a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how htmx can also be used to effectively handle JSON responses.

I created this because I feel there is a lack of comprehensive examples for managing JSON responses using htmx today.

## Demo

Here, you'll find htmx examples of next-previous pagination, numbered pagination, and infinite scrolling, all seamlessly integrated with JSON responses using client-side templates

On top of that, this site offers a demonstration of how a search bar can interact with JSON API using htmx.

## Support

Created by The Space Devs (TSD), the Spaceflight News API is a great resource for developers who want to add the latest spaceflight news to their apps.

It is a free API, but I do encourage users to support them through their Patreon to keep the API up and running.
