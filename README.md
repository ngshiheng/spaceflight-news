# Spaceflight News

## Technologies

This site is powered by [htmx](https://htmx.org/), [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), and the [Spaceflight News API (SNAPI)](https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/docs/).

## About

While htmx is designed to work best with [hypermedia responses](https://htmx.org/essays/two-approaches-to-decoupling/#hypermedia-network-architecture-decoupling), this website intends to serve as a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how htmx can also be used to effectively handle JSON responses.

I created this because I feel there is a lack of comprehensive examples for managing [JSON responses](https://htmx.org/essays/two-approaches-to-decoupling/#json-data-apis-application-level-decoupling) using htmx today.

## Demo

Here, you'll find htmx examples of [UX patterns for page loading](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/ecommerce/pagination-and-incremental-page-loading), e.g. pagination, load more, and infinite scrolling, all seamlessly integrated with JSON responses using [client-side templates](https://htmx.org/extensions/client-side-templates/).

On top of that, this site offers a demonstration of how a search bar can interact with JSON API using htmx.

## Support

Created by [The Space Devs (TSD)](https://thespacedevs.com/), the Spaceflight News API is a great resource for developers who want to add the latest spaceflight news to their apps.

It is a free API, but I do encourage users to support them through their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/TheSpaceDevs) to keep the API up and running.
